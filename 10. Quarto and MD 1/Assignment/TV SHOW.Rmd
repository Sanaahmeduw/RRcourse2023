## Basic Statistics
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)

### Create a sample data frame
data <- data.frame(Column1 = c("1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "11", "12"),
                   Column2 = c(4.64, 3.89, 4.53, 4.38, 4.38, 4.44, 4.03, 3.96, 4.45, 3.82, 3.96, 3.47))
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
# Your data
your_data <- data.frame(
  Stats = c("Mean", "Median", "SD", "Min", "Max", "Range"),
  Results = c(4.1625, 4.205, 0.340101088, 3.47, 4.64, 1.17))

# Create a table
kable(your_data, format = "html")
```
## Viewership Overtime 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
### Create a bar plot
ggplot(data, aes(x = Column1, y = Column2, fill = Column1)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Bar Plot of Values in Column 2",
       x = "Episodes",
       y = "Viewers in Millions") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

## Viewership Changes (Episode-to-episode)
```{r, echo=FALSE}
### Create a sample data frame
my_data <- data.frame(Series_Name = c("1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "11"),
                      Values = c(-0.75, 0.64, -0.15, 0, 0.06, -0.41, -0.07, 0.49, -0.63, 0.14, -0.49))

# Create a single color line plot
ggplot(my_data, aes(x = Series_Name, y = Values, group = 1)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  geom_point(color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Single Color Line Plot of Values",
       x = "Episodes",
       y = "Change in Viewership") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```
